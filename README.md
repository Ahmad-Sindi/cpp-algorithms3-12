# Algorithm Challenge #12 – Typical Matrices Check (Level 3)

🧮 Problem Description  
-
This C++ program generates two 3×3 matrices filled with random values, prints them, and checks whether they are *typical*.

Two matrices are considered typical if:
- Every element is equal
- Each value exists in the exact same position (row & column)

This algorithm uses direct element-by-element comparison.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Matrix traversal using nested loops
- Element-wise comparison techniques
- Early loop termination for efficiency
- Understanding structural vs abstract equality
- Writing precise and readable comparison logic

🧩 Example Output
-
Matrix 1:

02 05 07  
01 03 09  
06 04 08  

Matrix 2:

02 05 07  
01 03 09  
06 04 08  

Yes, Both Matrices are Typical.

📂 File Information
-
- **Language:** C++
- **File Name:** typical_matrices.cpp
- **Challenge Level:** Level 3
- **Challenge Number:** #12

💬 Notes
-
This challenge contrasts with Algorithm #11, where matrix equality
was determined using total sum comparison.

Here, precision is required:
structure and position matter more than aggregate values.
